          Teams from around the globe are gearing up for this historic moment,
          investing in state-of-the-art technologies to adapt their cars to the
          lunar conditions. Tires designed to grip the dusty surface,
          aerodynamics tailored for low-gravity maneuvers, and propulsion
          systems optimized for the lunar atmosphereâ€”all these elements come
          together to create a new era in the evolution of Formula 1.
